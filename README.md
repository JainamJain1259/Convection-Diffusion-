# Questions:

1.	Consider a one-dimensional unsteady convection-diffusion problem in a domain of L = 1. Two separate cases are to be considered: (i)   1   ,1, u  1 and (ii)  1   ,0.01, u  3 . The boundary conditions for the transported variable are: (i) x  0   ,0 (ii)   L,   1. Assume that initially   0.5 everywhere. Using the fully implicit formulation, solve for the distribution of  within the domain for each case, as a function of time. Use t  0.1. Implement both CDS and upwind scheme for each case. Perform the calculation till the steady state is reached. Plot the numerical results in the domain of interest for this purpose. Comment on the accuracy of the results, and on the suitability of CDS and upwind scheme with respect to the cell Peclet number.
2.	In a steady two-dimensional situation, the variable  is governed by
